## Arduino Sketch
The Arduino sketch is designed to print both to a serial monitor on a PC and a LCD screen that is mounted on the device.

## MAX31855 Library
Custom library that creates a class instance of each thermocouple amplifier and provides functions to read data, check errors, and do a rational polynomial caluclation to accurately determine the temperature.
